### Wangkezhen Building
The laboratory where I worked during my Ph.D. at Peking University was the [Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MiLab)](http://www.milab.wiki/). MiLab is located on the 9th floor of the Wangkezhen Building in the southeast corner of the Peking University campus.

Wangkezhen Building is the tallest building in Peking University. There is an interesting rumor about the buildings on the campus of Peking University, that is, no buildings are allowed to exceed the height of the Boya Tower. The reason for this rule is that the Boya Tower is a symbol of the spirit of Peking University, so it should always be at the highest point, and it should be insurmountable. The legend is so metaphysical that almost no one believes it, even though it is always told to one another. Another more convincing explanation is that because the campus of Peking University is too close to The Old Summer Palace, in order to protect the cultural relics and ancient buildings in The Old Summer Palace, large buildings are prohibited from being built around it.

Looking out the window from next door to my office, I can see the College Bridge at the intersection of North 4th Ring West Road and Zhong Guan Cun Street. Because it is adjacent to Zhong Guan Cun, it has become an important transportation hub, and it is also an important scenery around me during my doctoral life.

### May Fourth Stadium
May 4th is a day of great significance to China. In the important political movement that took place on this day in 1919, the students of Peking University played a leading role. It is for this reason that the stadium named after the May Fourth Movement is of extraordinary significance in Peking University as a unique role.

For me, this is where I used to exercise regularly during my undergraduate years. I have taken Shaolin Stick and Badminton classes, both of which are taught at the May Fourth Stadium. Since my postgraduate studies, I have changed the location of my exercise to Khoo Teck Puat Gymnasium, which is more suitable for targeted exercise.

Nevertheless, for several years after that, whenever I set foot on the May Fourth Stadium, time seems to return to the time when I was an undergraduate student in an instant. Seeing the youth playing in the stadium, I realize that I will not stay young forever, but in this stadium, there will always be people who are young. The familiar and nostalgic feeling of youth brought to me by the May Fourth Stadium is an eternal gift for me.
