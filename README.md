### Wangkezhen Building
The laboratory where I worked during my Ph.D. at Peking University was the [Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MiLab)](http://www.milab.wiki/). MiLab is located on the 9th floor of the Wangkezhen Building in the southeast corner of the Peking University campus.

Wangkezhen Building is the tallest building in Peking University. There is an interesting rumor about the buildings on the campus of Peking University, that is, no buildings are allowed to exceed the height of the Boya Tower. The reason for this rule is that the Boya Tower is a symbol of the spirit of Peking University, so it should always be at the highest point, and it should be insurmountable. The legend is so metaphysical that almost no one believes it, even though it is always told to one another. Another more convincing explanation is that because the campus of Peking University is too close to The Old Summer Palace, in order to protect the cultural relics and ancient buildings in The Old Summer Palace, large buildings are prohibited from being built around it.

Looking out the window from next door to my office, I can see the College Bridge at the intersection of North 4th Ring West Road and Zhongguancun Street. Because it is adjacent to Zhongguancun, it has become an important transportation hub, and it is also an important scenery around me during my doctoral life.
