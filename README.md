### Wangkezhen Building
The laboratory where I worked during my Ph.D. at Peking University was the [Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MiLab)](http://www.milab.wiki/). MiLab is located on the 9th floor of the Wangkezhen Building in the southeast corner of the Peking University campus.

Wangkezhen Building is the tallest building in Peking University. There is an interesting rumor about the buildings on the campus of Peking University, that is, no buildings are allowed to exceed the height of the Boya Tower. The reason for this rule is that the Boya Tower is a symbol of the spirit of Peking University, so it should always be at the highest point, and it should be insurmountable. The legend is so metaphysical that almost no one believes it, even though it is always told to one another. Another more convincing explanation is that because the campus of Peking University is too close to The Old Summer Palace, in order to protect the cultural relics and ancient buildings in The Old Summer Palace, large buildings are prohibited from being built around it.

Looking out the window from next door to my office, I can see the College Bridge at the intersection of North 4th Ring West Road and Zhong Guan Cun Street. Because it is adjacent to Zhong Guan Cun, it has become an important transportation hub, and it is also an important scenery around me during my doctoral life.

### May Fourth Stadium
May 4th is a day of great significance to China. In the important political movement that took place on this day in 1919, the students of Peking University played a leading role. It is for this reason that the stadium named after the May Fourth Movement is of extraordinary significance in Peking University as a unique role.

For me, this is where I used to exercise regularly during my undergraduate years. I have taken Shaolin Stick and Badminton classes, both of which are taught at the May Fourth Stadium. Since my postgraduate studies, I have changed the location of my exercise to Khoo Teck Puat Gymnasium, which is more suitable for targeted exercise.

Nevertheless, for several years after that, whenever I set foot on the May Fourth Stadium, time seems to return to the time when I was an undergraduate student in an instant. Seeing the youth playing in the stadium, I realize that I will not stay young forever, but in this stadium, there will always be people who are young. The familiar and nostalgic feeling of youth brought to me by the May Fourth Stadium is an eternal gift for me.

### Zhong Guan Cun & The Gate City Mall
Zhong Guan Cun, just south of Peking University, was and may still be the center for the development of China's cutting-edge software and computer industries. A large number of technology companies such as Microsoft Research Asia, iQiyi, and Sohu have their headquarters here. Therefore, for the students of Peking University, especially those majoring in computer related fields, many companies located in Zhong Guan Cun have become the first choice for internship because of their close proximity. I briefly interned at a medical intelligence company here, developing artificial intelligence algorithms for medical imaging.

The Gate City Mall is located in the center of Zhong Guan Cun, south of Zhong Guan Cun Square, where the Haidian Huangzhuang was around. Its history is not very long, but at least it has been around since I came to Beijing in 2015. It is no exaggeration to say that the Gate City Mall is one of the important activity places for all Peking University students. All kinds of restaurants, clothing stores and cosmetic stores are gathered here. In addition, there is also a movie theater closest to Peking University - Jinyi Cinema. The first movie I saw in Beijing, "The Little Prince", was in this theater, and it left a few but deep memories in my life at Peking University.

### Yan Yuan in Spring
Viewed from a high altitude, Weiming Lake and Boya Tower are in the center of the Yan Yuan. In their north there are some quaint courtyards, which house some research institutes "away from the mundane", among which I am impressed by the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research and the School of Archaeology and Museology. On the south side of Weiming Lake and Boya Tower, through the transition of an undulating mountain, from north to south, there are the biological specimen museum, the old biological building, the earth science building, and the cultural and historical building. A large area further south is occupied by teaching buildings and canteens. The southernmost area of Yan Yuan is the area with the most students, because almost all the student dormitories are distributed here.

Spring is the season of growth, and everything on campus is full of energy. Spring in Yanyuan is the most popular season for most PKUers, except those who are allergic to juniper pollen, including me. The shores of Weiming Lake are full of flowers of various colors. At a glance, red, yellow, pink, peach blossoms, apricot blossoms and jasmine flowers... all of which make people feel full of hope.

Whenever this time, I tell myself in my heart: it is time to dance!
